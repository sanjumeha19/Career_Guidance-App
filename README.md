# Career_Guidance-App

🛡️ Career Musketeer – Flutter UI/UX Project

Career Musketeer is a gamified career-guidance mobile application built using Flutter in Android Studio.
The app helps students and early-career professionals explore career paths, understand salary growth, and discover local job opportunities through an immersive, warrior-themed experience.
This project was developed during the CMR Hackathon, with a strong focus on UI/UX design, usability, and real-world relevance.


❗ Problem Statement

Students and fresh graduates often face confusion while choosing a career due to lack of clear guidance, uncertain salary expectations, and difficulty finding nearby opportunities.

Most career platforms provide large amounts of information but fail to present it in a simple, motivating, and visually engaging way. As a result, users feel overwhelmed and disconnected from their own career journey.

There is a need for an application that:

-> Clearly visualizes career growth

-> Shows realistic salary progression

-> Highlights local job opportunities

-> Keeps users engaged through an intuitive and motivating interface
Career Musketeer solves this problem by turning career exploration into a structured, gamified, and user-friendly experience.


✨ Concept & Design Approach

The app reimagines the career journey as a game-like progression, where users become “career warriors” building their own professional kingdom.

The design approach focuses on:

-> Strong visual hierarchy

-> Dark premium UI with gold highlights

-> Gamification without complexity

-> Smooth and distraction-free navigation

All UI screens were directly implemented in Flutter, ensuring design feasibility and real-time testing.
